## Requirements:

- Included fivemqueue
- I have edited the source code of https://github.com/anderscripts/FiveM_Queue and it will now add the changes to the queue count variables.

## Creating a Bot Application
1. Open https://discord.com/developers/applications and sign in
2. Click the button that says `'New Application'` in the top right hand corner of the page
3. Enter a name for your bot
4. In the menu on the left side of the page click `'Bot'` then click `'Add Bot'`
    - If you don't want random users to invite your bot, uncheck the feature that says `'Public Bot'` on the bot page
5. Your new bot's token will display under the name field and you can click `'Copy'` to copy the token to your clipboard

## Inviting a Bot
1. Open https://discord.com/developers/applications and sign in
2. In the menu on the left side of the page make sure you are on `'General Information'`
3. Locate the `'APPLICATION ID'` and click copy
4. With the ID you just copied insert it into the URL below where `'APPLICATIONID'` is; then open the link
    - https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=APPLICATIONID&scope=bot&permissions=8
